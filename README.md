# QAP 1

Instructions: [SDAT AND DEV OPS COMBINED QAP 1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18677542/SDAT.AND.DEV.OPS.COMBINED.QAP.1.pdf)

This project expands on a question from [QAP 1](https://github.com/BradTheeStallion/QAP1_Java_BA/blob/main/src/Account.java) of a Java course I did last term, but here have been significant improvements. My main goals were to: Use clean coding practices, set up at least three unit tests, and automate those tests using a GitHub Actions Workflow.

In addition to resources from my instructors, I have consulted the following:
